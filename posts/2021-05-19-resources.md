For the second time in 6 months I’m mentoring a new colleague at my company. And again - that person doesn't have a lot of experience in software development. One thing - telling him about our internal processes e.c. Other - what are my sources of knowledge? What do I use or have used to gain my knowledge?

I will try to categorize my sources down below.

# Books

* [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin)](https://www.audible.com/pd/Clean-Code-Audiobook/B08X7KL3TF)

This book was the “gotcha” moment for me. The moment when all started to make sense. I was coding for 3 years but what I was writing was a bunch of spaghetti code (and also - that was what my colleagues were writing) and I just could comprehend the whole coding idea. I knew there should be a better way. And alas - this book finally taught me that. Small methods, what tests should do, abstraction layers - finally a way to make the code fit in my small memory and brain.
Of course - this book is about “perfect code” and I do not necessarily agree with everything that is written there. But this is the closest I have ever been to agreeing with a book.

* [Multipliers (Liz Wiseman)](https://www.audible.com/pd/Multipliers-Revised-and-Updated-Audiobook/B06XY5L8GZ)

You can skip the first couple of chapters - a lot of running in circles. But after that there is a lot of good actionable advice that is usable in everyday teamwork.

* [How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen: A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7 (Joanna Faber , Julie King)](https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Talk-So-Little-Kids-Will-Listen-Audiobook/B01MYT9CNX)

Huh? A book about kids? Well in case you haven’t noticed - people are not good at communicating with people. And it is worse if we try to communicate with somebody who doesn’t really understand what we want from them. This book is actually very similar to “Multipliers”. Actually - they are pretty much the same. So give this one a go ;)
 
* [Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box (The Arbinger Institute)](https://www.audible.com/pd/Leadership-and-Self-Deception-Getting-Out-of-the-Box-Audiobook/B07H3DKP7X)

A bit naive but it made me think differently about my colleagues. Maybe this book is generated by a company that is trying to sell seminars and what not but it is short, interesting and made me think. Just don’t expect other people to just change their life because of this.

# Podcasts
* [Soft skills audio](https://softskills.audio/)

Two guys joking around, going offtopic and giving very valuable advice - what more can we hope for? Also - you can immediately listen to old episodes! All are interesting and insightful.

* [Open source security](https://opensourcesecurity.io/category/podcast/)

Two guys joking around, going offtopic … and I’m starting to see a pattern. Oh well. But if you are interested in software security - go for this one. (I’ll admit - as a developer and not a security person - some things go over my head. But it is still fun!)


# Talks

* [J.B. Rainsberger - The Economics of Software Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY)

Don’t you want to “reduce volatility in the marginal cost of features”? (I know - you didn't get the joke - just watch it - please!)

# Github repos

* [Developer roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

If you are just starting out - sometimes it is hard to understand - what are the things you should be learning about. This is just an excellent roadmap to understand - what can you expect working frontend or backend or in devops. I check annually to make sure I know at least the new keywords ;)

* [Awsome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Links to everything about anything. Or - something to do on cold winter nights :)
